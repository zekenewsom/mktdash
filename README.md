# mktdash: Market Analytics Platform

## Project Objective

To create an interactive and modular web-based market analytics platform for U.S. financial markets, including a Goldman Sachsâ€“style daily PDF report generator, using only free APIs and public data sources.

## Current Phase

Phase 1: Initial Structure and UI Scaffold

This phase establishes the foundational file structure for the frontend (React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui) and backend (Node.js, Express) and includes placeholder components and routes.

## Structure

The project uses a simple monorepo-like structure with `packages/frontend` and `packages/backend`, managed using **pnpm workspaces**.
